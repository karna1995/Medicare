# Medicare Data Analysis
In this project, I analyzed physician medicare payments by procedure for calendar year 2012. The main result is that a handful of States seem to receive an excessive amount (relative to all other States) in Medicare payments related to tests for illicit drugs (e.g., cocaine). This result persists even when correcting for differences in population and for the prevalence of drug abuse by State.

Please see "Medicare and Cocaine.pdf" for more details.
